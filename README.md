# Classroom-Chatbot-Smart-Assistant-for-Students

🧠 Overview

Classroom Chatbot is an AI-based assistant that helps students get instant updates and answers about assignments, deadlines, and events — reducing the workload of class representatives (CRs) and faculty. It automates responses, sends reminders, and handles repeated queries efficiently.

🌟 Key Features

🔐 Login/Signup System – Secure access for all users.
👥 Group Chat System – Admins create class groups, post updates, PDFs, images, and deadlines.
🔔 Auto Reminders – Sends notifications before submissions or events.
💬 Personal Chatbot – Students can ask doubts like “When is the assignment due?”
🧭 Smart Query Handling – Replies instantly or forwards new queries to CR/faculty.
🕵 Anonymous Mode – Ask questions without revealing identity.
🔒 Privacy Control – User chooses whether to send the query or not.

⚙ Workflow

1. User logs in or signs up.
2. Joins a group using an admin-generated group ID.
3. Admin/CR posts updates, deadlines, or files.
4. System sends automatic reminders before deadlines.
5. Student asks queries in the personal chatbot.
    If data exists → chatbot answers instantly.
    If not → query goes to the correct admin (optionally anonymous).
6. Student receives confirmation whether the query was sent or answered.
